## Requirements

This will require [Perl6](https://perl6.org) to be installed on your machine, along with the following modules:
- [Hiker](https://github.com/tony-o/perl6-hiker)
- [JSON::FAST](https://github.com/timo/json_fast)
- [HTTP::UserAgent](https://github.com/sergot/http-useragent)
- [Gonfig::From](https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-Config-From)

These can be easily be gotten using `zef` of `panda`, the module managers for Perl6.
